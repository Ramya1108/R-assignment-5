EXPLANATION:

1. matrix(data = NA, nrow = 1, ncol = 1, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = NULL): This line creates a matrix with one row and one column filled with NA (Not Available/Not Applicable) values.
2. A = matrix(1:100, nrow=10): This line creates a matrix named A with values from 1 to 100, arranged in 10 rows.
3. B = matrix(1:1000, nrow=10): This line creates a matrix named B with values from 1 to 1000, arranged in 10 rows.
4. t(A): This line transposes matrix A. Transposing a matrix means switching its rows with its columns.
5. B: This line simply outputs the matrix B.
6. a = c(2:5): This line creates a vector a containing values from 2 to 5.
7. b = c (1:2): This line creates a vector b containing values from 1 to 2.
8. X = a*A: This line multiplies each element of matrix A by the corresponding element of vector a, storing the result in matrix X.
9. Y = b*B: This line multiplies each element of matrix B by the corresponding element of vector b, storing the result in matrix Y.
10. a = c(1:10): This line redefines vector a to contain values from 1 to 10.
11. b = c(1:100): This line redefines vector b to contain values from 1 to 100.
12. S=matrix(2:5, nrow=2): This line creates a 2x2 matrix named S with values from 2 to 5.
13. det(S): This line calculates the determinant of matrix S. The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar value that can be computed from its elements.
14. solve(S): This line calculates the inverse of matrix S if it is invertible. The solve() function is used to find the solution to a system of linear equations, and for square matrices, it can also compute the inverse.
